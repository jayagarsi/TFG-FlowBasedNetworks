# TFG - Flow-Based Network Creation Games: Social Optima and Equilibria

This Repository contains the implementation of the source code used in the Final Degree Project, Flow-Based Network Creation Games: Social Optima and Equilibria. The [documentation]() of the project can be found in the doc folder, along with the [original article](https://github.com/jayagarsi/TFG-FlowBasedNetworks/blob/master/doc/IJCAI2020-Lenzner.pdf) that we studied for this. Regarding this repository, the code has been implemented mainly in C++ but there are some Python and Bash scripts too. 

## Repository Organisation

Source code for the simulation of Network Creation Game based on flow. The repository is organised as follows:
- The [doc](https://github.com/jayagarsi/TFG-FlowBasedNetworks/tree/master/test) folder contains the documentation used for the project, and some files with implementation info.
- The [src](https://github.com/jayagarsi/TFG-FlowBasedNetworks/tree/master/src) folder contains all the source code with the implementation of the Flow-Based NCG simulation, as well as python scripts to draw graphs and bash scripts to execute the different experiments.
- The [test](https://github.com/jayagarsi/TFG-FlowBasedNetworks/tree/master/test) folder, contains the results written on a csv of the different run experiments explained in the project memory.
